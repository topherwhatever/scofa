#' Initial Information Extraction for Present Exam
#'
#' This function extracts initial information from the present exam data.
#' The data should be in a directory named 'Hobbes Original' within the working directory.
#' The information extracted includes the exam code, cohort size, the number of items per form,
#' the number of response options, and the response option codes.
#'
#' @param hobbes_in_wd A string specifying the directory in the working directory where the hobbes files are stored. Default is NULL.
#' @return A list named 'exam_info' with the following elements:
#'  - 'exam_code': The name of the current working directory, which should be the exam code.
#'  - 'cohort_n': The number of rows in the pre-scored data, which should be the cohort size.
#'  - 'nitms_form': The number of columns minus 1 in the pre-scored data, which should be the number of items per form.
#'  - 'n_opts': The number of unique response options in the domain key.
#'  - 'i_opts': Number of distinct options.
#'  - 'codes': A string of response option codes. If there are more than 5, a warning is printed.
